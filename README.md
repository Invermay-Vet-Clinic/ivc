# Invermay Vet Clinic — Website scaffold

What this package contains:
- index.html — main page
- css/styles.css — styling
- js/main.js — minimal interaction
- robots.txt
- sitemap.xml

Images:
- Place your supplied logo as `images/logo.png`. The pages reference `images/logo.png`.
- Placeholder staff photos use external placeholder images; replace them with real photos in `images/staff/`.

Replace these placeholders:
- Clinic phone, address, email and website URLs in `index.html` and the JSON-LD block near the top.
- Replace the Google Maps iframe `src` with your clinic's actual Google Maps embed link.

Deployment:
- To preview locally: open `index.html` in a browser.
- For HTTPS hosting / production, place files on a web host or static-hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or your host).
- Configure real domain, SSL, analytics, and contact-form backend (e.g., Formspree, Netlify Forms, or a server endpoint).

Accessibility & SEO:
- Image `alt` attributes are included.
- Page contains basic Open Graph meta tags and JSON-LD schema for VeterinaryCare — update with real data.
- Add page-level meta tags and canonical tags if needed.

Next steps I can help with:
- Integrate an appointment booking service (e.g., Cliniko, EasyPractice) or create a backend form handler.
- Create additional pages (Fees, Resources, Blog) and a WordPress or headless CMS setup.
- Improve SEO content and add structured FAQ schema.

If you'd like, I can:
- Replace the placeholder contact info with the exact clinic details you provide.
- Produce a version tailored for WordPress or a static-generator (Jekyll/Hugo).
- Add booking integration and Google Analytics setup instructions.
